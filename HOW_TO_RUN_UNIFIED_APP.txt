# How to Run the Unified Application

I've designed a comprehensive solution that combines all phases (Phase 2 web app, Phase 3 chatbot, and Phase 5 advanced features) into a single unified backend application. Here's how to run it:

## Files Created:

1. `unified_backend.py` - Main unified backend application
2. `start_unified_app.py` - Simple startup script
3. `UNIFIED_APP_README.md` - Complete documentation
4. Updated `run_phase5_backend.py` - Enhanced Phase 5 runner

## Running Options:

### Option 1: Unified Backend (Recommended)
Run the completely unified application with all phases combined:

```bash
python unified_backend.py
```

Or use the starter script:
```bash
python start_unified_app.py
```

### Option 2: Enhanced Phase 5 Backend
Run the Phase 5 backend which now includes all phases:

```bash
python run_phase5_backend.py
```

## Accessing Features:

Once running at http://localhost:8000, you can access:

- **Phase 2 Web App**: `/auth/*` and `/basic-tasks/*` endpoints
- **Phase 3 Chatbot**: `/chat/*` endpoints
- **Phase 5 Advanced Features**: `/tasks/*` endpoints with recurring tasks, due dates, priorities, etc.

## Frontend Navigation:

From the frontend, you can navigate between different features by calling the appropriate backend endpoints:

- For traditional web app: Use `/basic-tasks/*` endpoints
- For chatbot: Use `/chat/*` endpoints
- For advanced features: Use `/tasks/*` endpoints

The unified backend ensures all functionality is available from a single server, allowing seamless switching between features from the frontend.
